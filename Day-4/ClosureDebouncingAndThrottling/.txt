Debouncing vs. Throttling: https://dev.to/shameel/javascript-debouncing-vs-throttling-55kh
==========================
Use debouncing when you want to delay the execution of a function until a user stops interacting with an element. 
This is suitable for scenarios like autocomplete suggestions or real-time search.

Use throttling when you want to limit the rate at which a function can be called. 
It's ideal for handling events like scrolling, resizing, or mouse movement.

Example:
=======
For a real world example when user is typing in an input and the delay is 1 second, then:

In debouncing, the function will be executed after 1 second when the user stops typing. 
This means that if the user continues to type within the 1-second delay, t
he function execution will be postponed until there is a 1-second pause in typing.

It's executed once.
In throttling, the function will be executed after every 1 second at regular intervals if the user keeps triggering the event. 
Throttling allows the function to be executed at regular intervals (e.g., every 1 second), as long as the user keeps triggering the event.

It limits the frequency of function calls, ensuring it doesn't execute too often, even if the event is fired frequently.
