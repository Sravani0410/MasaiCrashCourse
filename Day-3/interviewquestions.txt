2.what are the http methods?
2. what is the difference between put and patch?
    -PUT is like giving something to server to replace an existing item completely. 
    Its like replacing the number-blocks in the toy shelf with a new one. 
    This method is used to update an existing resource on a server.
     For example, a user may use this method to change entire profile information
    -The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no side effect),
     whereas successive identical POST requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.
    -A PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. 
    Contrast this with PUT; which is always idempotent. 
    The word "idempotent" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. 
    For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a PUT will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for PATCH.
